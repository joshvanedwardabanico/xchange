# User Stories
### A user story is a short, simple description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the end user. It explains what the user wants to achieve and why in plain language, typically following a format like:
### "As a [type of user], I want to [do something] so that [reason or benefit]."

1. As a user, I want to be able to propose a skill exchange to another user in a simple and transparent way, so that I can obtain the service I need in exchange for one I offer.
2. As a user, I want to be able to create a detailed listing of the skills I offer and those I am looking for, so that I can be easily found by those interested in an exchange.
3. As a user, I want to be able to communicate with other users through an internal chat to discuss the details of the exchange, agree on the terms, and resolve any doubts or misunderstandings.
